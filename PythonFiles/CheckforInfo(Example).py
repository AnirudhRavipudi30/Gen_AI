# Given data: Flight delays in minutes
delays = [15, 30, 45, 30, 50, 60, 30, 20]

# Step 1: Compute Mean (Average Delay)
mean_delay = statistics.mean(delays)

# Step 2: Compute Mode (Most Frequent Delay)
mode_delay = statistics.mode(delays)

# Step 3: Compute Variance (Spread of Delays)
variance_delay = statistics.variance(delays)

# Step 4: Compute Range (Max - Min Delay)
range_delay = max(delays) - min(delays)

# Step 5: Compute Standard Deviation (How Much Delays Deviate from Mean)
std_dev_delay = statistics.stdev(delays)

# Print the results
