# ðŸ”¹ Set Theory Explanation:
# - Union (A âˆª B): Students in at least one of the courses.
# - Intersection (A âˆ© B): Students in both Science and Arts.
# - Difference (A - B or B - A): Students in only one course.
# - Complement: Students in neither course.

# Given data
total_students = 250
science_students = 150
arts_students = 100
both_courses = 40  # Students enrolled in both Science & Arts

# Compute set operations
only_science = science_students - both_courses  # Science but NOT Arts
only_arts = arts_students - both_courses  # Arts but NOT Science
union = science_students + arts_students - both_courses  # At least one course
neither = total_students - union  # Students in neither Science nor Arts
