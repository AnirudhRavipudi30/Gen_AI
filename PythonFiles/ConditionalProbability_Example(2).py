# ðŸ”¹ Conditional Probability Explanation:
# - P(A | B) = Probability of A occurring given B has happened.
# - Example: P(Approved | High Credit) = Applicants with high credit AND approved / Applicants with high credit.

# Given data
total_applicants = 1000
high_credit_score = 600
loan_approved = 400
both_high_credit_and_approved = 350

# Compute conditional probabilities
P_approved_given_credit = both_high_credit_and_approved / high_credit_score  # P(A | B)
P_credit_given_approved = both_high_credit_and_approved / loan_approved  # P(B | A)
